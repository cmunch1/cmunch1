### Hi! ðŸ‘‹


**I'm Chris, a data analysis enthusiast currently seeking to change careers into Data Analysis / Machine Learning / Data Science.**

Please let me know if anybody has any leads on a job or tips they could share. I'm primarily looking for a remote job. You can see my resume at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-munch/).

### Background

<img align="right"  width="250" height="250" src="./assets/plm-microscope.jpg">

I have a BS in Physics, but most of my career has been in the commercial lab testing industry, analyzing asbestos and mold samples with polarized light microscopy and electron microscopy. 

I started back in the day when most of these kind of labs didn't really use computers that much, and I became heavily involved in setting up data management systems for these labs.

I even became an independent software developer at one point, designing and selling a LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) for these labs. 

I've pretty much done everything in the industry - set up a lab from scratch and take it through an onsite audit and accreditation, set up and manage quality systems, train people, manage people, fire people, etc...

I discovered Machine Learning and Data Science about a year and a half ago. I was amazed at how much learning material was online. It looked awesome, and it looked like a great match with my background - a bit of coding, databases, math, statistics, and science.

### About Me

Married, 2 daughters, 2 dogs, 2 cats.
