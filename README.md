### Hi! 👋


**I'm Chris, a tech enthusiast looking to change careers into AI / ML / Data.**

### Background

<img align="right"  width="250" height="250" src="./assets/plm-microscope.jpg">

I have a BS in Physics, but most of my career has been in the commercial lab testing industry, analyzing asbestos and mold samples with polarized light microscopy and electron microscopy. 

I started back in the day when most of these kind of labs didn't really use personal computers that much, and I became heavily involved in setting up data management systems for these labs.

I even became an independent software developer at one point, designing and selling a LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) for these labs. 

I've pretty much done everything in the industry - set up a lab from scratch and take it through an onsite audit and accreditation, set up and manage quality systems, train people, manage people, fire people, etc...

I discovered all the free learning material available for AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science a couple of years ago and have been really excited to jump in.

### About Me

Married, 2 daughters, 2 dogs, 2 cats.
